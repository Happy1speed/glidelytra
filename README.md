A Minecraft Mod for Fabric that Aims to rebalance the Elytra in a fun way.

Inspired by the Legacy console edition Glide minigame, this mod features boost rings! (the tunnels were a little much for vanilla minecraft so I just made them rings)

These are multiblocks that boost you when you fly above them!

Firework Rockets now have a cooldown and their cooldown increases slightly per flight durration but not enough to make the upgrade useless.

Your Elytra will also recharge durrability when you're not flying.
