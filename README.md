A Minecraft Mod for Fabric that Aims to rebalance the Elytra in a fun way.

Inspired by the Legacy console edition Glide minigame, this mod features boost rings! (the tunnels were a little much for vanilla minecraft so I just made them rings)

These are multiblocks that boost you when you fly above them!

Firework Rockets now have a cooldown and their cooldown increases slightly per flight durration but not enough to make the upgrade useless.

Your Elytra will also recharge durrability when you're not flying.

How to make the Multiblock:
